# Traveling Salesman Problem with Tabu Search

This project is an implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research focused on optimization. In this problem, a salesman is given a list of cities and must determine the shortest route that allows him to visit each city once and return to his original location.

The Tabu Search is a metaheuristic search method employing local search methods used for mathematical optimization. It enhances the performance of local search by using memory structures that describe the visited solutions or changes applied to them. If a potential solution has been previously visited within a certain short-term period or if a particular modification was recently made to the current solution, it is marked as "tabu" (forbidden) so that the algorithm does not consider that possibility repeatedly.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `tabu_search.py`: This file contains the implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm. It includes functions for calculating the distance between cities, generating the initial solution, getting the neighbors of the current solution, and the main Tabu Search function.

- `analyze.py`: This script is used to analyze the results of the Tabu Search algorithm. It loads the data from a CSV file, groups the data by parameters, and generates various plots to visualize the execution time, memory usage, and best distance found for different numbers of cities and parameters.

- `TSPdata.csv`: This CSV file contains the data generated by running the Tabu Search algorithm. Each row represents a single run of the algorithm with a specific set of parameters. Columns include the number of cities, maximum iterations, tabu size, best distance found, execution time, and memory usage.

## Usage

To run the Tabu Search algorithm, execute the `tabu_search.py` script. The results will be saved in the `TSPdata.csv` file.

To analyze the results, run the `analyze.py` script. This will generate a series of plots in the `analyze_plots` directory.

## Requirements

This project is written in Python and requires the following libraries:

- pandas
- os
- random
- time
- psutil
- argparse
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Please ensure these are installed before running the scripts.

## tabu_search function

The `tabu_search` function is the main function that implements the Tabu Search algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Here's a more detailed description of how it works:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes three parameters as input: `cities`, `max_iterations`, and `tabu_size`. `cities` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a city. `max_iterations` is the maximum number of iterations the algorithm should run for, and `tabu_size` is the size of the tabu list, which is a list that keeps track of the recently visited solutions to prevent the algorithm from revisiting them.

2. **Initial Solution**: The function first generates an initial solution, which is a random permutation of the cities. This is done by shuffling the list of cities.

3. **Tabu List**: The function then initializes an empty tabu list. This list will be used to store the recently visited solutions.

4. **Main Loop**: The function enters a loop that runs for `max_iterations` iterations. In each iteration, it generates the neighborhood of the current solution, which is a set of solutions that can be reached by swapping two cities in the current solution. It then selects the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list. If all solutions in the neighborhood are in the tabu list, it selects the best solution regardless of the tabu list. This solution becomes the current solution for the next iteration.

5. **Tabu List Update**: After each iteration, the function updates the tabu list. It adds the current solution to the tabu list, and if the size of the tabu list exceeds `tabu_size`, it removes the oldest solution from the tabu list.

6. **Best Solution**: The function keeps track of the best solution found so far, along with its distance. If the current solution has a shorter distance than the best solution, the current solution becomes the new best solution.

7. **Output**: After `max_iterations` iterations, the function returns the best solution found and its distance.



## main.py
`main.py`: This is the main driver script of the project. It orchestrates the execution of the Tabu Search algorithm with different parameters and collects the results. Here's a more detailed description of its functionality:

  - It iterates over different numbers of cities, tabu sizes, and maximum iterations. For each combination of these parameters, it runs the Tabu Search algorithm.

  - The cities are selected from a predefined list of known cities.

  - Before each run of the Tabu Search algorithm, it records the start time. After the run, it records the end time. The difference between these times is the execution time of the algorithm.

  - It also records the memory usage of the process running the Tabu Search algorithm.

  - The best route found by the Tabu Search algorithm, along with its distance, the execution time, memory usage, and the parameters used, are stored in a row of a pandas DataFrame.

  - It also calls a function to plot the best route found by the Tabu Search algorithm.

  - After all runs of the Tabu Search algorithm are completed, it saves the DataFrame to a CSV file for further analysis.



## analyze.py
`analyze.py`: This script is used to analyze the results of the Tabu Search algorithm. It performs the following tasks:

  - It loads the data from the `TSPdata.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame. Each row in the DataFrame represents a single run of the Tabu Search algorithm with a specific set of parameters.

  - It groups the data by the number of cities, maximum iterations, and tabu size. This allows for a more detailed analysis of how these parameters affect the performance of the Tabu Search algorithm.

  - It generates various plots to visualize the execution time, memory usage, and best distance found for different numbers of cities and parameters. These plots provide a visual representation of the performance of the Tabu Search algorithm.

  - It uses the seaborn and matplotlib libraries to generate the plots. The plots are saved in the `analyze_plots` directory.

  - To better visualize the data between certain ranges, it applies a logarithmic scale to the x-axis of the plots.

  - The plots are saved as PNG files for further analysis and presentation.


## Conclusions from TSP Tabu Search Analysis

1. **Execution Time Trends**:
   - Execution time generally increases with the number of max iterations and the number of cities.
   - Increasing max iterations leads to higher execution times, holding other parameters constant.
   - Increasing the number of cities also results in higher execution times.

2. **Memory Usage Trends**:
   - Memory usage tends to increase with both max iterations and the number of cities.
   - Higher max iterations and city counts correspond to higher memory usage.

3. **Best Distance Achieved**:
   - The best distance achieved remains constant across different parameter configurations, indicating possible convergence to a local optimum.
   - However, this could also suggest that the dataset contains a single instance of the TSP with a fixed optimal solution.

4. **Impact of Tabu Size**:
   - Increasing tabu size generally leads to higher execution times and memory usage.

5. **Impact of City Count**:
   - Increasing the number of cities results in higher execution times and memory usage, as expected.

6. **Optimization Performance**:
   - While the best distance achieved remains constant, further analysis with different datasets is needed to assess optimization performance comprehensively.

7. **Scalability**:
   - Execution times and memory usage increase significantly with larger problem sizes, indicating limited scalability for larger city counts.
